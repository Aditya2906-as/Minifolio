📌 Project Overview

Minifolio is a lightweight and responsive mini portfolio web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is designed to showcase basic personal information, skills, and projects in a clean, interactive, and user-friendly layout.

The main goal of Minifolio is to demonstrate core frontend development concepts, including responsive design, DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI interactivity without using any external frameworks or libraries.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

🧰 Technologies Used

HTML – Structure and content layout

CSS – Styling, responsiveness, hover effects, and layout design
